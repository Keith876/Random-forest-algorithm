# Random-forest-algorithm
## Project Overview
This project utilizes a random forest algorithm to predict the presence of heart disease based on key health indicators:  age, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate. The random forest algorithm is an ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to classify whether a person has heart disease. It reduces overfitting and improves prediction accuracy by aggregating results from multiple trees.
